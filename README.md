# ssrdemo

A demo of server side rendering. Having a case for non-SSR and SSR.

Using react to generate a html file on the server side and sending it to the client.


- Server Side Rendering (SSR), Isomorphic Javascript or Universal Javascript is the process of taking a client side Javascript Framework website and rendering to static HTML and CSS on the server.

- Applications that have the ability to render both on the server and on the client are called universal apps.

- Helps you render your website faster on the browser.

- Helps search engine optimization, allowing crawlers to see your website, and indexing the content that was rendered.

- There is a cost:

  - Time and effort needed on the server side.
  - Adds extra complexity on the back-end.
